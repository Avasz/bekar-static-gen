#+OPTIONS: num:0 toc:nil
#+OPTIONS: html-postamble:nil

Currently programming parts are written in the bash script.

*** Note
    *THIS IS THE IDEA DRAFT, EVERY THING MIGHT NOT WORK*

* Support

  | markup  | blog | pages |
  |---------+------+-------|
  | org-mod | yes  | yes   |
  |         |      |       |

* Workings

  =main.sh= is the *bekar*'s controller which switch between the
  commands and pass the *arguments* and *parameters*. *Commands* are
  executable independently.

* Testing

  See =src/Makefile= for sample tests.

* Layout

  |            | id       | Description                  |
  |------------+----------+------------------------------|
  | navigation | #nav     | top fixed ribbon of the page |
  | panel      | #panel   | vertical panel               |
  | content    | #content |                              |
  | footer     | #footer  |                              |


* Working of the Generator

  =gen.sh= handles the plain html generation, and linking the
  pages. If the content is written in supported markup, it will be
  converted automatically.

** Tags

   You can directly tags the page/folder and change it behaviour
   accordingly. For blog tag page/folder as blog.

   List of Default tags

   | Name   | Description |
   |--------+-------------|
   | #blog  |             |
   | #home  |             |
   | #index |             |
   | #about |             |

* Blog

  Unlike the plain html generation of markup contents, blogs are
  loaded by the javascript,

* Working with org-mode

** Removing Footer

   blog would not require this method.

   #+BEGIN_SRC org-mod
     #+OPTIONS: html-postamble:nil
   #+END_SRC

* Convetions

  These are the guideline convention used.

** Naming

*** path, flags variables
    - add `PATH_`, `FLAG_` suffix respectively

*** library variables
    - add `LIB_` suffix

*** library functions
    - add `lib_` suffix

** File Descriptors

   | Descriptor | verbosity uses    |
   |------------+-------------------|
   | 3, 4       | commands          |
   | 5          | library functions |
